# Battleship Commonware

This repository contains an example implementation of Battleship
built on top of Commonware primitives.
It serves as an exercise to familiarize myself with the framework.
The Battleship logic is using https://github.com/orhun/battleship-rs.

## Usage

Concrete usage instructions can be found in the Rust doc strings in [src/lib.rs](./src/lib.rs).
